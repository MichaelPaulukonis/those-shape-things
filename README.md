# shape things

inspired by work of https://bsky.app/profile/leedoughty.bsky.social


## ideas

- https://www.gorillasun.de/blog/dashed-lines-in-p5js/
- "sparkles" from https://p5js.org/tutorials/custom-shapes-and-smooth-curves/
- rounded corners on corners
- fat square cross
- double-line circle, double-line square
- combine two tiles
- equidistant circle/square insets (like stripes)
- dashed-line segments matching over circles
- improve circle conditioning
- zig-zag starburst
- "atomic" loops
- radial-lines poking out from behind circle/square
- two opposing quarter-circles
- circle-of-circles with same-size circle in center
- divide into overlays and underlays
  - underlays are opaque
  - but some overlays are opaque and SMALLER
